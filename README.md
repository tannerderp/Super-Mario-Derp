# Super-Mario-Derp
WIP Mario game being created using the p5 javascript library
# checklist
- [x] main menu
- [x] basic mario objects and enemies
- [x] level editor
- [ ] sharing levels online
- [ ] completed main story levels (I will design more objects and blocks for those levels)
# how to play
arrow keys or wasd - move and jump\
z, x, or space - run\
# level editor controls
arrows or wasd - move camera\
space - open object and block menu\
in the menu, click an object to use it, it will take you back to the editor, where you can place that object by clicking. you can use the eraser in the top right to erase stuff, and once you place mario you can run the level by clicking on the play button in the top right.
