# Super-Mario-Derp
Mario game being made using p5 using sprites from past mario games. I am planning on having a campaign set of levels, a level editor, and an online level sharing thing.
# what about super mario p5?
Except for the sprites and sounds, I am completely starting over. I was very inefficient when I was coding super mario p5, and I've become a lot more efficient since them. I can do collisions way better, and I would like to do the levels completely different. So, forget about super mario p5.
